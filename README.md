**K-means clustering**


K-means clustering is one of the simplest and most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It is used to solve clustering problems in machine learning or data science. 
Clustering is a set of techniques used to partition data into groups or clusters. Clusters are loosely defined as groups of data objects that are more similar to other objects in their cluster than they are to data objects in other clusters. In practice, clustering helps identify two qualities of data: Meaningfulness and Usefulness.
What is K-Means Algorithm?
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters or groups that need to be created in the process, as if K=5, there will be five clusters, and for K=10, there will be ten clusters, and so on. The k-means clustering algorithm mainly performs two tasks:


1) Determines the best value for K center points.


2) Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Groups assign based on k center points by measuring the distance between k points and data points.
